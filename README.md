Circle warp
===========

Experiment in `canvas` trying to recreate some manipulated photos I saw once (can't remember where). See experiment write up [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/labs/circle-warp/). Also uses `getUserMedia()` in supported browsers to use webcam video stream.

Performance isn't too hot in browsers other than Chrome.

**See live demo [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/demos/canvas/warp/)**

Fonts from [Google web fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) and all photos from respective owners on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), used with CC licenses.

TO DO

- Add *save image* feature - have already tried this but seems to crash all browsers apart from Firefox.
